# Writeup for The Secret Store (WEB70) (70)

> Solves: 267
> Description: We all love secrets. Without them, our lives would be dull. A student wrote a secure secret store, however he was babbling about problems with the database. Maybe I shouldn't use the 'admin' account. Hint1: Account deletion is intentional. Hint2: I can't handle long usernames.

We tried login as `admin` `admin` and suddenly we got the flag :)
